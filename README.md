## My process

This was relatively easy to make as it took me around an hour or so to finish. I used the typical way of creating an outer container and divving up the smaller components into their own containers. 

I mainly focused on practicing with Flexbox since it seems like the go-to way to align items in a neat way. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This challenge was more about reinforcing than learning I would say! 

### Continued development

It would be cool to make interesting animations when the website loads, but for now, I have no plans to add on to this since I'm confident with this submission.
